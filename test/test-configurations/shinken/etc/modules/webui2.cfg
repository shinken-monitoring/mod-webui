   ## Modules for WebUI
   ## User authentication:
   # - auth-cfg-password (internal) : Use the password set in Shinken contact for auth.
   # - auth-htpasswd (internal)     : Use an htpasswd file for auth backend.
   # You may remove the modules 'auth-cfg-password' and 'auth-htpasswd' from your
   # configuration because the WebUI embeds those authentication methods.
   #
   # You may use these external modules:
   # - auth-ws-glpi                 : Use the Glpi Web Services for user authentication
   # - auth-active-directory        : Use AD for auth backend (and retrieve photos).

   # htpasswd (apache like) file containing username/passwords
   # Use an Apache htpasswd file or build your own (http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/)
   #htpasswd_file               /etc/shinken/htpasswd.users

   ## Modules for WebUI
   ## Graphs:
   # You may use these external modules:
   # - ui-pnp                : Use PNP graphs in the UI.
   # - ui-graphite2          : Use graphs from Graphite time series database.


   ## Modules for WebUI
   ## Storage:
   # - mongodb (internal)    : Save user preferences to a Mongodb database
   #                         : Get hosts/services availability from a Mongodb database
   #                         : Get Shinken logs and hosts history from a Mongodb database
   # You may remove the module 'mongodb' from your configuration because the WebUI
   # embeds this storage module.
   #
   # You may also use those external modules:
   # - SQLitedb              : Save user preferences to a SQLite database

   # with different parameters than the default ones.

   # business_impact is greater than or equal this value

   # 3 - production
   # 4 - important
   # 5 - top-for-business

   # precedence over the UI problems_business_impact which takes precedence over the important_problems_business_impact!

   # Set to 1 to deactivate Web UI own problems computation rules
   # As per default the WebUI builds its own 'problem' state for the hosts and services
